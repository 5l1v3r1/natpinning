1) make server tool work in two different operations
 -automated test mode
        * will most likely require commmand channel between client and server
        * going to be flash as well, or use python client for this?
 -exploit mode
 
 Should they really be mutually exclusive? PErhaps add option to test mode which asks user wether he wants to connect back to the port?
 
 
2) Add more protocols / types per protocol (where aplicable)
